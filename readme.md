Start point:
I donâ€™t know what is going on with Javascript and APIs, and I hate feeling like this.  I want to get over the paralyzing fear of working with them.  If I can get comfortable with getting a map up, accessing the weather, and getting data to be stored and displayed using various dropdowns, I'll be happy.  I don't think it's a far cry from doing these three discrete things to getting them to interact with each other.  

Learning goals:
Javascript: get comfortable working with it; and
APIs - learn how they interact with each other and get comfortable using them.  

MVP: an app that allows a single user to:
store their plants in a database;
gets local weather (hard-coded to Edinburgh);
warns them of adverse weather conditions coming up;
allows people to delete plants if the plants are harvested;
and delivers plant notes to the screen based on an on-click button.  

Extensions:
get a google map to identify the local post code, then interact with the weather API for updates;
create different conditions for different plants (roses and rhubarb would be treated differently, for example);
use a calendar API to plant and sow; and
send notifications or alerts to the screen without an on-click.
